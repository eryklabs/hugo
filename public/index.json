These disks can easily be stored in offsite locations, taking up minimal space (inside a DVD binder, for example). Hence, the choice to add a BDXL-capable drive, for burning 25 GB disks (verified with checksum) for long-term archival.\nEach disk will get:\nSHA256 checksum text file inside. Label printed with permanent ink or laser etching (no stickers, no sharpies). Stored vertically in jewel cases or archival sleeves (avoid spindles). Kept in an airtight plastic bin with silica gel, inside a closet (no sunlight). Note: 25 GB single-layer discs are more reliable than 50 GB ones: fewer layers, fewer focus calibration issues, and much lower uncorrectable error rates over time.) I might use 50 GB disks for less critical data however, and verify immediately with checksum after burning.\nI was considering 128 GB BDXL disks, however I later became aware of the fact that the lower capacity M-Disks have a much longer true archival lifespan (between 300-1,000 years, theoretically). 100-128 GB disks are supposed to be much less stable long-term, only 5-10 years, which won\u0026rsquo;t fit our use case.\n(Note: Disks should be checked periodically to ensure readability and confirm the efficacy of the backup system).\n🔧 Environment / Hardware Component Purpose Cooler Master HAF 932 Full-tower chassis with airflow and drive capacity Corsair RM850x Stable, silent 850W PSU H60x RGB Elite CPU cooler (repurposed) ECC-capable motherboard + Ryzen CPU ZFS stability and data integrity 64GB ECC DDR4 RAM ZFS ARC cache + container workloads 6× 16TB Seagate Exos drives RAIDZ2 pool (tank) for redundancy 2× 480GB SSDs Boot mirror (TrueNAS OS) LSI 9300-8i HBA (IT Mode) Direct SATA access for ZFS Intel X520-DA2 Dual-port 10GbE NIC APC Smart-UPS Power protection and clean shutdowns 🧠 Software Stack Tool / Service Function TrueNAS SCALE (23.x) Core NAS OS ZFS RAIDZ2 Redundant storage pool SMB / NFS / iSCSI File sharing and VM storage MinIO (S3) Object storage for Proxmox backups Rsyslog / Fluent Bit Centralized log forwarding Scrub / Snapshot / Replication Data protection and versioning AD / LDAP integration Simulated enterprise ACL structure UPS daemon (NUT) Power loss detection and shutdown 📐 Configuration \u0026amp; Methodology ZFS Pool Setup\nPool: tank Layout: 6×16TB → RAIDZ2 Compression: zstd Atime: off Snapshots: 15-min: 48h retention Hourly: 7 days Daily: 90 days Replication: weekly off-box copy via external disk.

Most basic commands and sequences to remember: 1. Hugo Startup (Local) Starting up your Hugo Site Locally\n1. Open your terminal or PowerShell and cd into your site’s root directory — the one that contains config.toml, themes/, and content/.\ncd D:\\path\\to\\your\\hugo-site\n2. Start the local server\nRun this command:\nhugo server\nor if you want it to automatically rebuild on file changes:\nhugo server -D\n3. Open in your browser\nOnce it starts, Hugo will print something like:\nWeb Server is available at http://localhost:1313/\nOpen that URL in your browser.\n2. Correct global image locations (for Cover Image in Frontmatter) If you want images available globally (to any page or post), use:\n/static/images/\nSo in your filesystem:\nC:\\Projects\\ProjectName\\static\\images\\homelab\\example.jpg\nThen anywhere in your Markdown:\n![My Logo](/images/logo.png)\nThat will render correctly on both the local server and deployed site, because /static maps directly to the web root /.\nFor example, on this page, the Hugo logo is inserted via this code snippet in the frontmatter:\ncover:\nimage: \u0026quot;/images/hugo/hugo-logo-wide.svg\u0026quot;\n3. Insert an image into the page If you don’t need custom margins or width:\n![Example text](/images/image.jpg)\nExample used at the top of this page:\n![Hugo logo](/images/hugo/hugo-logo-wide.svg)\n4. Insert code block Like this:\n```bash\rhugo server -D``` Explanation:\nStart of code block →\n```bash ``` tells Markdown “start a fenced code block” and “use Bash syntax highlighting.” (The word bash is optional — it just enables color-coding for shell commands.)\nResult:\nhugo server -D 5. Make a hyperlink open in new tab Option 1:\nMarkdown itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t support opening links in a new tab.\nTo do so, we\u0026rsquo;ll have to insert HTML inside Markdown, like so:\nCheck out \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://eryklabs.com\u0026quot; target=\u0026quot;_blank\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noopener noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;my site\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.\nOption 2:\nMake all external links open in new tabs automatically\nAdd this JavaScript snippet to your PaperMod footer partial or via custom JS (e.g., /assets/js/custom.js):\n\u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.querySelectorAll(\u0026#39;a[href^=\u0026#34;http\u0026#34;]\u0026#39;).forEach(link =\u0026gt; { if (!link.href.includes(window.location.hostname)) { link.setAttribute(\u0026#39;target\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;_blank\u0026#39;); link.setAttribute(\u0026#39;rel\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;noopener noreferrer\u0026#39;); } }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; 6. Link to another page within your Hugo site Use ref (absolute to site root)\nIf you want links to stay valid regardless of the page\u0026rsquo;s location:\nUse [Home Page]({{\u0026lt; ref \u0026ldquo;index.md\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt;}}) to link to another page.\nref creates an absolute link from the site root. Another example:\n[TrueNAS Project]({{\u0026lt; ref \u0026ldquo;projects/truenas/index.md\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt;}})\n7. Making text colored Insert the code \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color: #00d28f;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;colored text\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; between the text you want a different color.\n8.

A pain point of mine has been running out of storage on every device (phones, laptops, desktops, etc.)\u0026hellip; Keeping track of backups on various external drives scattered about is not good practice, and thus I am looking to find a proper long term, scaleable solution.\nCold Storage: M-Disc BD-R 25 GB Taking the 3-2-1 principle into consideration, long term cold-storage backups on 25 GB M-Disks is something I think worthwhile to implement. These disks can easily be stored in offsite locations, taking up minimal space (inside a DVD binder, for example). Hence, the choice to add a BDXL-capable drive, for burning 25 GB disks (verified with checksum) for long-term archival.\nEach disk will get:\nSHA256 checksum text file inside. Label printed with permanent ink or laser etching (no stickers, no sharpies). Stored vertically in jewel cases or archival sleeves (avoid spindles). Kept in an airtight plastic bin with silica gel, inside a closet (no sunlight). Note: 25 GB single-layer discs are more reliable than 50 GB ones: fewer layers, fewer focus calibration issues, and much lower uncorrectable error rates over time.) I might use 50 GB disks for less critical data however, and verify immediately with checksum after burning.\nI was considering 128 GB BDXL disks, however I later became aware of the fact that the lower capacity M-Disks have a much longer true archival lifespan (between 300-1,000 years, theoretically). 100-128 GB disks are supposed to be much less stable long-term, only 5-10 years, which won\u0026rsquo;t fit our use case.\n(Note: Disks should be checked periodically to ensure readability and confirm the efficacy of the backup system).\n🔧 Environment / Hardware Component Purpose Cooler Master HAF 932 Full-tower chassis with airflow and drive capacity Corsair RM850x Stable, silent 850W PSU H60x RGB Elite CPU cooler (repurposed) ECC-capable motherboard + Ryzen CPU ZFS stability and data integrity 64GB ECC DDR4 RAM ZFS ARC cache + container workloads 6× 16TB Seagate Exos drives RAIDZ2 pool (tank) for redundancy 2× 480GB SSDs Boot mirror (TrueNAS OS) LSI 9300-8i HBA (IT Mode) Direct SATA access for ZFS Intel X520-DA2 Dual-port 10GbE NIC APC Smart-UPS Power protection and clean shutdowns 🧠 Software Stack Tool / Service Function TrueNAS SCALE (23.x) Core NAS OS ZFS RAIDZ2 Redundant storage pool SMB / NFS / iSCSI File sharing and VM storage MinIO (S3) Object storage for Proxmox backups Rsyslog / Fluent Bit Centralized log forwarding Scrub / Snapshot / Replication Data protection and versioning AD / LDAP integration Simulated enterprise ACL structure UPS daemon (NUT) Power loss detection and shutdown 📐 Configuration \u0026amp; Methodology ZFS Pool Setup\nPool: tank Layout: 6×16TB → RAIDZ2 Compression: zstd Atime: off Snapshots: 15-min: 48h retention Hourly: 7 days Daily: 90 days Replication: weekly off-box copy via external disk.

Consumer RAM is a liability. RAIDZ1 is obsolete for multi-terabyte drives — URE risk is real. iSCSI performs best with separate VLAN and jumbo frames. TrueNAS SCALE’s Kubernetes layer is useful but overkill for critical data — isolate core datasets. UPS integration with NUT daemon is non-negotiable.

Most basic commands and sequences to remember: 1. Hugo Startup (Local) Starting up your Hugo Site Locally\n1. Open your terminal or PowerShell and cd into your site’s root directory — the one that contains config.toml, themes/, and content/.\ncd D:\\path\\to\\your\\hugo-site\n2. Start the local server\nRun this command:\nhugo server\nor if you want it to automatically rebuild on file changes:\nhugo server -D\n3. Open in your browser\nOnce it starts, Hugo will print something like:\nWeb Server is available at http://localhost:1313/\nOpen that URL in your browser.\n2. Correct global image locations (for Cover Image in Frontmatter) If you want images available globally (to any page or post), use:\n/static/images/\nSo in your filesystem:\nC:\\Projects\\ProjectName\\static\\images\\homelab\\example.jpg\nThen anywhere in your Markdown:\n![My Logo](/images/logo.png)\nThat will render correctly on both the local server and deployed site, because /static maps directly to the web root /.\nFor example, on this page, the Hugo logo is inserted via this code snippet in the frontmatter:\ncover:\nimage: \u0026quot;/images/hugo/hugo-logo-wide.svg\u0026quot;\n3. Insert an image into the page If you don’t need custom margins or width:\n![Example text](/images/image.jpg)\nExample used at the top of this page:\n![Hugo logo](/images/hugo/hugo-logo-wide.svg)\n4. Insert code block Like this:\n```bash\rhugo server -D``` Explanation:\nStart of code block →\n```bash ``` tells Markdown “start a fenced code block” and “use Bash syntax highlighting.” (The word bash is optional — it just enables color-coding for shell commands.)\nResult:\nhugo server -D 5. Make a hyperlink open in new tab Option 1:\nMarkdown itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t support opening links in a new tab.\nTo do so, we\u0026rsquo;ll have to insert HTML inside Markdown, like so:\nCheck out \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://eryklabs.com\u0026quot; target=\u0026quot;_blank\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noopener noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;my site\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.\nOption 2:\nMake all external links open in new tabs automatically\nAdd this JavaScript snippet to your PaperMod footer partial or via custom JS (e.g., /assets/js/custom.js):\n\u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.querySelectorAll(\u0026#39;a[href^=\u0026#34;http\u0026#34;]\u0026#39;).forEach(link =\u0026gt; { if (!link.href.includes(window.location.hostname)) { link.setAttribute(\u0026#39;target\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;_blank\u0026#39;); link.setAttribute(\u0026#39;rel\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;noopener noreferrer\u0026#39;); } }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; 6. Link to another page within your Hugo site Use ref (absolute to site root)\nIf you want links to stay valid regardless of the page\u0026rsquo;s location:\nUse [Home Page]({{\u0026lt; ref \u0026ldquo;index.md\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt;}}) to link to another page.\nref creates an absolute link from the site root. Another example:\n[TrueNAS Project]({{\u0026lt; ref \u0026ldquo;projects/truenas/index.md\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt;}})\n7. Making text colored Insert the code \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color: #00d28f;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;colored text\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; between the text you want a different color.\n8.

A pain point of mine has been running out of storage on every device (phones, laptops, desktops, etc.)\u0026hellip; Keeping track of backups on various external drives scattered about is not good practice, and thus I am looking to find a proper long term, scaleable solution.\nCold Storage: M-Disc BD-R 25 GB Taking the 3-2-1 principle into consideration, long term cold-storage backups on 25 GB M-Disks is something I think worthwhile to implement. These disks can easily be stored in offsite locations, taking up minimal space (inside a DVD binder, for example). Hence, the choice to add a BDXL-capable drive, for burning 25 GB disks (verified with checksum) for long-term archival.\nEach disk will get:\nSHA256 checksum text file inside. Label printed with permanent ink or laser etching (no stickers, no sharpies). Stored vertically in jewel cases or archival sleeves (avoid spindles). Kept in an airtight plastic bin with silica gel, inside a closet (no sunlight). Note: 25 GB single-layer discs are more reliable than 50 GB ones: fewer layers, fewer focus calibration issues, and much lower uncorrectable error rates over time.) I might use 50 GB disks for less critical data however, and verify immediately with checksum after burning.\nI was considering 128 GB BDXL disks, however I later became aware of the fact that the lower capacity M-Disks have a much longer true archival lifespan (between 300-1,000 years, theoretically). 100-128 GB disks are supposed to be much less stable long-term, only 5-10 years, which won\u0026rsquo;t fit our use case.\n(Note: Disks should be checked periodically to ensure readability and confirm the efficacy of the backup system).\n🔧 Environment / Hardware Component Purpose Cooler Master HAF 932 Full-tower chassis with airflow and drive capacity Corsair RM850x Stable, silent 850W PSU H60x RGB Elite CPU cooler (repurposed) ECC-capable motherboard + Ryzen CPU ZFS stability and data integrity 64GB ECC DDR4 RAM ZFS ARC cache + container workloads 6× 16TB Seagate Exos drives RAIDZ2 pool (tank) for redundancy 2× 480GB SSDs Boot mirror (TrueNAS OS) LSI 9300-8i HBA (IT Mode) Direct SATA access for ZFS Intel X520-DA2 Dual-port 10GbE NIC APC Smart-UPS Power protection and clean shutdowns 🧠 Software Stack Tool / Service Function TrueNAS SCALE (23.x) Core NAS OS ZFS RAIDZ2 Redundant storage pool SMB / NFS / iSCSI File sharing and VM storage MinIO (S3) Object storage for Proxmox backups Rsyslog / Fluent Bit Centralized log forwarding Scrub / Snapshot / Replication Data protection and versioning AD / LDAP integration Simulated enterprise ACL structure UPS daemon (NUT) Power loss detection and shutdown 📐 Configuration \u0026amp; Methodology ZFS Pool Setup\nPool: tank Layout: 6×16TB → RAIDZ2 Compression: zstd Atime: off Snapshots: 15-min: 48h retention Hourly: 7 days Daily: 90 days Replication: weekly off-box copy via external disk.

Consumer RAM is a liability. RAIDZ1 is obsolete for multi-terabyte drives — URE risk is real. iSCSI performs best with separate VLAN and jumbo frames.

A pain point of mine has been running out of storage on every device (phones, laptops, desktops, etc.)\u0026hellip; Keeping track of backups on various external drives scattered about is not good practice, and thus I am looking to find a proper long term, scaleable solution.\nCold Storage: M-Disc BD-R 25 GB Taking the 3-2-1 principle into consideration, long term cold-storage backups on 25 GB M-Disks is something I think worthwhile to implement. These disks can easily be stored in offsite locations, taking up minimal space (inside a DVD binder, for example). Hence, the choice to add a BDXL-capable drive, for burning 25 GB disks (verified with checksum) for long-term archival.\nEach disk will get:\nSHA256 checksum text file inside. Label printed with permanent ink or laser etching (no stickers, no sharpies). Stored vertically in jewel cases or archival sleeves (avoid spindles). Kept in an airtight plastic bin with silica gel, inside a closet (no sunlight). Note: 25 GB single-layer discs are more reliable than 50 GB ones: fewer layers, fewer focus calibration issues, and much lower uncorrectable error rates over time.) I might use 50 GB disks for less critical data however, and verify immediately with checksum after burning.\nI was considering 128 GB BDXL disks, however I later became aware of the fact that the lower capacity M-Disks have a much longer true archival lifespan (between 300-1,000 years, theoretically). 100-128 GB disks are supposed to be much less stable long-term, only 5-10 years, which won\u0026rsquo;t fit our use case.\n(Note: Disks should be checked periodically to ensure readability and confirm the efficacy of the backup system).\n🔧 Environment / Hardware Component Purpose Cooler Master HAF 932 Full-tower chassis with airflow and drive capacity Corsair RM850x Stable, silent 850W PSU H60x RGB Elite CPU cooler (repurposed) ECC-capable motherboard + Ryzen CPU ZFS stability and data integrity 64GB ECC DDR4 RAM ZFS ARC cache + container workloads 6× 16TB Seagate Exos drives RAIDZ2 pool (tank) for redundancy 2× 480GB SSDs Boot mirror (TrueNAS OS) LSI 9300-8i HBA (IT Mode) Direct SATA access for ZFS Intel X520-DA2 Dual-port 10GbE NIC APC Smart-UPS Power protection and clean shutdowns 🧠 Software Stack Tool / Service Function TrueNAS SCALE (23.x) Core NAS OS ZFS RAIDZ2 Redundant storage pool SMB / NFS / iSCSI File sharing and VM storage MinIO (S3) Object storage for Proxmox backups Rsyslog / Fluent Bit Centralized log forwarding Scrub / Snapshot / Replication Data protection and versioning AD / LDAP integration Simulated enterprise ACL structure UPS daemon (NUT) Power loss detection and shutdown 📐 Configuration \u0026amp; Methodology ZFS Pool Setup\nPool: tank Layout: 6×16TB → RAIDZ2 Compression: zstd Atime: off Snapshots: 15-min: 48h retention Hourly: 7 days Daily: 90 days Replication: weekly off-box copy via external disk.

Consumer RAM is a liability. RAIDZ1 is obsolete for multi-terabyte drives — URE risk is real. iSCSI performs best with separate VLAN and jumbo frames. TrueNAS SCALE’s Kubernetes layer is useful but overkill for critical data — isolate core datasets. UPS integration with NUT daemon is non-negotiable. Sudden power loss will corrupt metadata. ➡️ Next Steps Deploy Proxmox Backup Server with MinIO offload. Automate snapshot replication to secondary node (SV-001).

Most basic commands and sequences to remember: 1. Hugo Startup (Local) Starting up your Hugo Site Locally\n1. Open your terminal or PowerShell and cd into your site’s root directory — the one that contains config.toml, themes/, and content/.\ncd D:\\path\\to\\your\\hugo-site\n2. Start the local server\nRun this command:\nhugo server\nor if you want it to automatically rebuild on file changes:\nhugo server -D\n3. Open in your browser\nOnce it starts, Hugo will print something like:\nWeb Server is available at http://localhost:1313/\nOpen that URL in your browser.\n2. Correct global image locations (for Cover Image in Frontmatter) If you want images available globally (to any page or post), use:\n/static/images/\nSo in your filesystem:\nC:\\Projects\\ProjectName\\static\\images\\homelab\\example.jpg\nThen anywhere in your Markdown:\n![My Logo](/images/logo.png)\nThat will render correctly on both the local server and deployed site, because /static maps directly to the web root /.\nFor example, on this page, the Hugo logo is inserted via this code snippet in the frontmatter:\ncover:\nimage: \u0026quot;/images/hugo/hugo-logo-wide.svg\u0026quot;\n3. Insert an image into the page If you don’t need custom margins or width:\n![Example text](/images/image.jpg)\nExample used at the top of this page:\n![Hugo logo](/images/hugo/hugo-logo-wide.svg)\n4. Insert code block Like this:\n```bash\rhugo server -D``` Explanation:\nStart of code block →\n```bash ``` tells Markdown “start a fenced code block” and “use Bash syntax highlighting.” (The word bash is optional — it just enables color-coding for shell commands.)\nResult:\nhugo server -D 5. Make a hyperlink open in new tab Option 1:\nMarkdown itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t support opening links in a new tab.\nTo do so, we\u0026rsquo;ll have to insert HTML inside Markdown, like so:\nCheck out \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://eryklabs.com\u0026quot; target=\u0026quot;_blank\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noopener noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;my site\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.\nOption 2:\nMake all external links open in new tabs automatically\nAdd this JavaScript snippet to your PaperMod footer partial or via custom JS (e.g., /assets/js/custom.js):\n\u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.querySelectorAll(\u0026#39;a[href^=\u0026#34;http\u0026#34;]\u0026#39;).forEach(link =\u0026gt; { if (!link.href.includes(window.location.hostname)) { link.setAttribute(\u0026#39;target\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;_blank\u0026#39;); link.setAttribute(\u0026#39;rel\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;noopener noreferrer\u0026#39;); } }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; 6. Link to another page within your Hugo site Use ref (absolute to site root)\nIf you want links to stay valid regardless of the page\u0026rsquo;s location:\nUse [Home Page]({{\u0026lt; ref \u0026ldquo;index.md\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt;}}) to link to another page.\nref creates an absolute link from the site root. Another example:\n[TrueNAS Project]({{\u0026lt; ref \u0026ldquo;projects/truenas/index.md\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt;}})\n7. Making text colored Insert the code \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color: #00d28f;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;colored text\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; between the text you want a different color.\n8.

A pain point of mine has been running out of storage on every device (phones, laptops, desktops, etc.)\u0026hellip; Keeping track of backups on various external drives scattered about is not good practice, and thus I am looking to find a proper long term, scaleable solution.\nCold Storage: M-Disc BD-R 25 GB Taking the 3-2-1 principle into consideration, long term cold-storage backups on 25 GB M-Disks is something I think worthwhile to implement. These disks can easily be stored in offsite locations, taking up minimal space (inside a DVD binder, for example). Hence, the choice to add a BDXL-capable drive, for burning 25 GB disks (verified with checksum) for long-term archival.\nEach disk will get:\nSHA256 checksum text file inside. Label printed with permanent ink or laser etching (no stickers, no sharpies). Stored vertically in jewel cases or archival sleeves (avoid spindles). Kept in an airtight plastic bin with silica gel, inside a closet (no sunlight). Note: 25 GB single-layer discs are more reliable than 50 GB ones: fewer layers, fewer focus calibration issues, and much lower uncorrectable error rates over time.) I might use 50 GB disks for less critical data however, and verify immediately with checksum after burning.\nI was considering 128 GB BDXL disks, however I later became aware of the fact that the lower capacity M-Disks have a much longer true archival lifespan (between 300-1,000 years, theoretically). 100-128 GB disks are supposed to be much less stable long-term, only 5-10 years, which won\u0026rsquo;t fit our use case.\n(Note: Disks should be checked periodically to ensure readability and confirm the efficacy of the backup system).\n🔧 Environment / Hardware Component Purpose Cooler Master HAF 932 Full-tower chassis with airflow and drive capacity Corsair RM850x Stable, silent 850W PSU H60x RGB Elite CPU cooler (repurposed) ECC-capable motherboard + Ryzen CPU ZFS stability and data integrity 64GB ECC DDR4 RAM ZFS ARC cache + container workloads 6× 16TB Seagate Exos drives RAIDZ2 pool (tank) for redundancy 2× 480GB SSDs Boot mirror (TrueNAS OS) LSI 9300-8i HBA (IT Mode) Direct SATA access for ZFS Intel X520-DA2 Dual-port 10GbE NIC APC Smart-UPS Power protection and clean shutdowns 🧠 Software Stack Tool / Service Function TrueNAS SCALE (23.x) Core NAS OS ZFS RAIDZ2 Redundant storage pool SMB / NFS / iSCSI File sharing and VM storage MinIO (S3) Object storage for Proxmox backups Rsyslog / Fluent Bit Centralized log forwarding Scrub / Snapshot / Replication Data protection and versioning AD / LDAP integration Simulated enterprise ACL structure UPS daemon (NUT) Power loss detection and shutdown 📐 Configuration \u0026amp; Methodology ZFS Pool Setup\nPool: tank Layout: 6×16TB → RAIDZ2 Compression: zstd Atime: off Snapshots: 15-min: 48h retention Hourly: 7 days Daily: 90 days Replication: weekly off-box copy via external disk.

Correct global image locations (for Cover Image in Frontmatter) If you want images available globally (to any page or post), use:\n/static/images/\nSo in your filesystem:\nC:\\Projects\\ProjectName\\static\\images\\homelab\\example.jpg\nThen anywhere in your Markdown:\n![My Logo](/images/logo.png)\nThat will render correctly on both the local server and deployed site, because /static maps directly to the web root /.\nFor example, on this page, the Hugo logo is inserted via this code snippet in the frontmatter:\ncover:\nimage: \u0026quot;/images/hugo/hugo-logo-wide.svg\u0026quot;\n3.

Insert code block Like this:\n```bash\rhugo server -D``` Explanation:\nStart of code block →\n```bash ``` tells Markdown “start a fenced code block” and “use Bash syntax highlighting.” (The word bash is optional — it just enables color-coding for shell commands.)\nResult:\nhugo server -D 5. Make a hyperlink open in new tab Option 1:\nMarkdown itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t support opening links in a new tab.\nTo do so, we\u0026rsquo;ll have to insert HTML inside Markdown, like so:\nCheck out \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://eryklabs.com\u0026quot; target=\u0026quot;_blank\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noopener noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;my site\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.\nOption 2:\nMake all external links open in new tabs automatically\nAdd this JavaScript snippet to your PaperMod footer partial or via custom JS (e.g., /assets/js/custom.js):\n\u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.querySelectorAll(\u0026#39;a[href^=\u0026#34;http\u0026#34;]\u0026#39;).forEach(link =\u0026gt; { if (!link.href.includes(window.location.hostname)) { link.setAttribute(\u0026#39;target\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;_blank\u0026#39;); link.setAttribute(\u0026#39;rel\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;noopener noreferrer\u0026#39;); } }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; 6. Link to another page within your Hugo site Use ref (absolute to site root)\nIf you want links to stay valid regardless of the page\u0026rsquo;s location:\nUse [Home Page]({{\u0026lt; ref \u0026ldquo;index.md\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt;}}) to link to another page.\nref creates an absolute link from the site root.

Make a hyperlink open in new tab Option 1:\nMarkdown itself doesn\u0026rsquo;t support opening links in a new tab.\nTo do so, we\u0026rsquo;ll have to insert HTML inside Markdown, like so:\nCheck out \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://eryklabs.com\u0026quot; target=\u0026quot;_blank\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noopener noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;my site\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.\nOption 2:\nMake all external links open in new tabs automatically\nAdd this JavaScript snippet to your PaperMod footer partial or via custom JS (e.g., /assets/js/custom.js):\n\u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.querySelectorAll(\u0026#39;a[href^=\u0026#34;http\u0026#34;]\u0026#39;).forEach(link =\u0026gt; { if (!link.href.includes(window.location.hostname)) { link.setAttribute(\u0026#39;target\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;_blank\u0026#39;); link.setAttribute(\u0026#39;rel\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;noopener noreferrer\u0026#39;); } }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; 6. Link to another page within your Hugo site Use ref (absolute to site root)\nIf you want links to stay valid regardless of the page\u0026rsquo;s location:\nUse [Home Page]({{\u0026lt; ref \u0026ldquo;index.md\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt;}}) to link to another page.\nref creates an absolute link from the site root. Another example:\n[TrueNAS Project]({{\u0026lt; ref \u0026ldquo;projects/truenas/index.md\u0026rdquo; \u0026gt;}})\n7. Making text colored Insert the code \u0026lt;span style=\u0026quot;color: #00d28f;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;colored text\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; between the text you want a different color.\n8.
