# should I delete this config.toml? 
# chatgpt says: 1️⃣ Empty config.toml — should it have anything?

# Yes — normally it’s fine to have only one config file, either config.toml or hugo.toml.
# In your case, you already have hugo.toml (and it’s the one Hugo is using).
# That empty config.toml is leftover junk from setup and is not used at all.

# 👉 You can safely delete it:

# del config.toml


# Hugo will only use one config file — the one named hugo.toml.
