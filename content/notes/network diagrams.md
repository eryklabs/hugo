## Best Editors

<a href="https://Draw.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color:#00d28f;">Draw.io</a>
- Free, runs locally or in browser, imports/export PNG/SVG/PDF.
- If you want professional network symbols: Diagrams.net + Cisco symbol pack is best.

## Formatting Tricks
To center a column in Markdown tables:
```bash
|:--------:|
```
This centers the column text.


## Commands I Use Often
```bash
hugo server -D
hugo new content/blog/new-post.md
```

## Things to Note
- Never run ```hugo``` from inside ```/content/```
- ```paginate``` was replaced by ```pagination.pagerSize```

Now when you run the server, you’ll have:
