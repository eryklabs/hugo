<br/> 



## 1. Hugo Startup (Local)

Starting up your Hugo Site Locally

### 1. Open your terminal or PowerShell and cd into your site’s root directory — the one that contains config.toml, themes/, and content/.

`cd D:\path\to\your\hugo-site`

### 2. Start the local server

Run this command:

`hugo server`

or if you want it to automatically rebuild on file changes:

`hugo server -D`

### 3. Open in your browser

Once it starts, Hugo will print something like:

`Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/`

Open that URL in your browser.
