**Step 1: Initialize Git in Huge Site Folder**

```bash
cd C:\Projects\eryklabs   # ← your folder
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
<br/>

**Step 2: Create a GitHub repo**

Go to https://github.com/new

Repository name: hugo (or whatever matches your site name).

Leave it Public or Private (up to you).

Don’t initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license — you already have a local repo.

Click Create repository.
